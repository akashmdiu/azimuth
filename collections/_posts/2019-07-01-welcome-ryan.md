Ryan is a data scientist with environmental and GIS experience. He will be helping implement on-demand forecasting into our EnviMetric product as well as chipping in on other products in the public safety arena.  Ryan is somewhat unique in that he is a software developer, data scientist, and a licensed environmental engineer.  Ryan was previously a software engineer at Temple University where he built data analysis and visualization applications in bioinformatics. prior to that he was a practicing environmental engineer with Langan Engineering. We count ourselves lucky to have Ryan on our team and look forward to all the great work he'll be doing to continuously improve our products and services.
